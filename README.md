# The Pantry
# A food-based app

This website allows users to add food items in their possession onto a virtual database and then search for recipes based off of those item and create a shopping-list for items not in their store.  Users may also take advantage of a manual ingredient-based recipe search and an ingredient-substitute search feature.  The app utilizes Spoontacular's Food API to achieve these capabilities; it also utilizes the Google Maps API to provides the user with the locations of grocers in their current area.
